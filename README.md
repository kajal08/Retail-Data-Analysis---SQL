## 🗂️ Database Schema
The analysis is performed on three relational tables:

### 1. CUSTOMER
- CUSTOMER_ID  
- DOB  
- GENDER  
- CITY_CODE  

### 2. PROD_CAT_INFO
- PROD_CAT_CODE  
- PROD_SUB_CAT_CODE  
- PROD_CAT  
- PROD_SUBCAT  

### 3. TRANSACTIONS
- TRANSACTION_ID  
- CUST_ID  
- PROD_CAT_CODE  
- PROD_SUB_CAT_CODE  
- STORE_TYPE  
- QTY  
- TOTAL_AMT  
- TRAN_DATE
